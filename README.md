This is just a small project with some sorting algorithms, graphs and trees. It is made for fun and to freshen up stuff that I have learned during my studies.

Contents
--------
So far the following things are implemented.

**Collections**
- Binary Tree
- Red-Black Tree

**Graphs**
- Un-directed
- Directed

**Sort**
- Bogo sort
- Bubble sort
- Heap sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Selection sort
- Shell sort

TODO
----
- Improve documentation
- Implement various serching algorithms
- Improve test code and scenarios

Thanks to
