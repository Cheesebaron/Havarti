=======
The goal with this project is for fun to educate myself about data structures and algorithms and for future reference.
Not only that, but to create generic implementations which can be useful for various projects both for me and for others.
Feel free to fork and discuss the implementations.

Contents
--------
So far the following things are implemented.

**Collections**
- Binary Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- PriorityQueue
  + Based on LinkedList
  + Based on BinaryTree

**Graphs**
- Un-directed
- Directed

**Sort**
- Bogo sort
- Bubble sort
- Heap sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Selection sort
- Shell sort

TODO
----
- Improve documentation
- Implement various searching algorithms (A*, RBFS, etc.)
- Improve test code and scenarios
